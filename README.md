## OVERVIEW:

Online transaction fraud is a growing concern in the digital world, and it's crucial to develop effective fraud detection systems using advanced machine learning algorithms like XGBoost. These systems analyze transaction data in real-time, identifying suspicious patterns to protect consumers and businesses. Key components include robust data infrastructure, advanced models, and user-friendly interfaces. XGBoost, known for its high accuracy and performance, is employed for real-time fraud detection, combining multiple decision trees to improve detection capabilities. Ongoing development and maintenance are essential to keep the system effective in countering evolving fraud tactics.

## DATASET:

For this task, I collected a dataset from Kaggle, which contains historical information about fraudulent and non fraudulent transactions which can be used to detect fraud in online payments.

## Data Cleaning and Preparation :

Data cleaning and preparation are crucial steps in building an effective online transaction and Cleaning the data by removing duplicates, filling in missing values, correcting inconsistencies, and removing outliers. 

## Training:

Logistic regression: It predicts the output of a categorical dependent variable. 
Random Forest: It takes the prediction from each tree and based on the majority votes of predictions, and it predicts the final output
XGBoost: is a decision tree-based ensemble algorithm that uses gradient boosting to improve model performance by combining multiple weaker models.

## Classification Metrics

To check how well our model we use some metrics to find the accuracy of our model. There are many types of classification metrics available in Scikit learn, Confusion Matrix, Accuracy Score Precision, Recall, F1-Score.
